# VDP-0003 Draft Self-Review

This is an authoring self-review. It is not an independent review.

## Structural Validation

VDP-0003 uses canonical YAML metadata, depends on VDP--001, VDP-0000, VDP-0001, and VDP-0002, remains Draft / 0.1.0, and contains all canonical VDP sections required by VDP--001.

## Requirement Inventory

The draft contains 117 contiguous normative requirements, VDP-0003-REQ-001 through VDP-0003-REQ-117.

| Semantic Corrections | 098-112 | 15 |
| Execution Review Resolution | 113-117 | 5 |

## Context Review

Pass. The draft defines immutable Processing Context and covers repository discovery result, Processing Request, Processor Descriptor, Negotiation Result, accepted specifications, configuration, policies, exact profile definition, extensions, supported versions, capability selection, mode, declared external inputs, identity, and provenance.

## Environment Review

Pass. The draft separates Execution Environment from Context and covers filesystem, network, sandbox, memory, CPU, operating system, interactive state, clock, and process limits.

## Capability Review

Pass. The draft defines Capability, identifier namespaces, dependency, negotiation, lifecycle authority, profiles, selected capabilities, limitations, and non-authority.

## Lifecycle Review

Pass. Experimental, Draft, Stable, Deprecated, and Removed lifecycle states are defined, kept independent of Processor version, and separated from implementation support.

## Negotiation Review

Pass. Processor Descriptor, Processing Request, Negotiation Result, support status, availability status, lifecycle status, dependency state, version compatibility, and limitations are covered without defining a transport protocol.

## Profile Review

Pass. Profiles compose existing capabilities and never introduce new behavior or authority. Profile identity, version, source, exact definition, required and optional capabilities, dependency closure, lifecycle status, and conflicts are covered.

## Processing Result Contract Review

Pass. The draft defines abstract result obligations for Context identity, Processor Descriptor, Processing Request, Negotiation Result, support, availability, lifecycle, dependency state, profile identity, limitations, policy restrictions, version incompatibilities, extension influence, and reproducibility limits without defining serialization, JSON, CLI, HTTP, MCP, LSP, hosted API, validator interface, or repository graph serialization.

## Security Review

Pass. Capability spoofing, profile escalation, unknown capabilities, conflicting declarations, version mismatches, malicious extensions, malicious configuration, environment injection, and capability downgrade are addressed.

## VDP-0002 Boundary Review

Pass. The draft treats corrected VDP-0002 decisions as fixed: discovery occurs before Processor execution, Processor consumes a Discovered Repository Result, Context and Environment are separate, profiles and capabilities determine conditional processing, catastrophic interruption remains possible, Processor outputs remain derived, and determinism is scoped to equivalent context, profile, capability, configuration, and declared inputs.

## Negotiation Ordering Audit

Pass. The draft now orders Discovered Repository Result, Processor Descriptor, Processing Request, Capability Negotiation, Negotiation Result, Processing Context construction, Context freeze, VDP-0002 Processing Session, and Processing Result.

## Pre-Session Boundary Audit

Pass. Processor Descriptor exists before session creation. Processing Request exists before negotiation. Negotiation Result exists before Context freeze. The Processing Session begins only after Context freeze.

## Support / Availability / Lifecycle Separation Audit

Pass. Support status is separate from availability status, lifecycle status, and dependency state. Environment and policy restrictions are separate from implementation support.

## Capability Lifecycle Authority Audit

Pass. Processors cannot assign authoritative lifecycle maturity by themselves. Implementation-declared lifecycle claims are non-authoritative unless backed by an accepted lifecycle source, and conflicts are governed by authoritative sources.

## Context Identity and Reproducibility Audit

Pass. Context identity is mandatory. Processing Results must reference the exact Context identity or include equivalent reproducible Context records. Missing provenance cannot be fabricated.

## Capability Namespace Audit

Pass. Capability identifiers must include source namespace or authority class. Local identifiers are not globally standardized, unknown namespaces are preserved, and namespace ownership is not inferred from hosting or popularity.

## Profile Identity and Version Audit

Pass. Profile definitions have identity, version, source, composed capabilities, required and optional capabilities, dependency closure, lifecycle status when applicable, limitations, and compatibility expectations. Distinct profiles with the same display name are not silently merged.

## Dependency Closure Audit

Pass. Required dependency closure is mandatory before fully supported selection. Optional dependencies remain distinct. Unknown dependencies, cycles, version constraints, lifecycle compatibility, support, availability, policy restrictions, and extension requirements are accounted for.

## Policy Authority Audit

Pass. Policy authority is scoped to explicit grants from Accepted specifications or valid governance records. Policies cannot override the Constitution, override Accepted VDPs generally, redefine capability semantics, create authority, lower conformance, bypass lifecycle, or convert derived output into authority.

## VDP-0002 Compatibility Audit

Pass. VDP-0002 remains unchanged and consistent. VDP-0003 now defines pre-session Context and capability semantics without redefining the Processor.

## Descriptor Provenance Audit

Pass. Processor Descriptor identity includes implementation family or product identity, implementation revision or equivalent provenance, descriptor identity, supported specifications, capabilities, profiles, limitations, environment assumptions, extension boundary, implementation lifecycle claims, and known authoritative lifecycle sources.

## Lifecycle Authority Absence Audit

Pass. Authoritative lifecycle may be absent or unknown. Implementation-declared lifecycle claims remain non-authoritative, absence is disclosed, absence does not automatically make a capability unsupported, and conformance requiring authoritative maturity cannot pass without it.

## Policy Conflict Precedence Audit

Pass. Negotiation uses explicit precedence for policy conflicts, reports out-of-scope policy effects, preserves in-scope policy effects, and prevents full success for unresolvable authority or scope conflicts.

## Availability Extensibility Audit

Pass. Availability categories are a minimum open semantic set. Unknown future categories are preserved and reported and cannot be silently mapped to available.

## Session Creation Boundary Audit

Pass. Negotiation, Context construction, and Context freeze are pre-session. Session creation occurs only after Context freeze, and negotiation or Context construction failure creates no Processing Session.

## Cross-VDP-0002 Consistency Audit

Pass. VDP-0003 now aligns with VDP-0002 Model B: pre-session orchestration creates and freezes Context, then the Processor lifecycle begins with Created.

## Validation Performed

- Confirmed VDP--001 exists.
- Confirmed VDP-0000 exists.
- Confirmed VDP-0001 exists.
- Confirmed corrected VDP-0002 exists on the base branch.
- Confirmed canonical sections are present.
- Confirmed requirement identifiers are contiguous.
- Confirmed existing requirement IDs 001 through 097 are preserved.
- Confirmed new requirement IDs begin at 098 and remain contiguous through 117.
- Confirmed negotiation occurs before Processing Session creation.
- Confirmed exact Descriptor identity is preserved.
- Confirmed absent authoritative lifecycle is reported.
- Confirmed implementation claims remain non-authoritative.
- Confirmed policy conflicts have deterministic precedence.
- Confirmed availability categories are extensible but safe.
- Confirmed session creation occurs after Context freeze.
- Confirmed negotiation failure creates no Processing Session.
- Confirmed support, availability, lifecycle, and dependency dimensions are separate.
- Confirmed Context identity and Result linkage are mandatory.
- Confirmed capability namespaces and profile identity are required.
- Confirmed required dependency closure is mandatory.
- Confirmed policy authority is scoped.
- Confirmed no implementation artifacts were created.

## Open Questions

- Concrete capability registry remains future work.
- Concrete profile registry remains future work.
- Manifest integration remains future work.
- Diagnostics format remains future work.
- Result serialization remains future work.
- Extension wire protocol remains future work.

## Recommendation

VDP-0003 is ready for follow-up independent execution review.
