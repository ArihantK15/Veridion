# Processing Context and Capability Model

## Abstract

VDP-0003 defines the immutable Processing Context and capability system used by Veridion Processors. It specifies what semantic inputs are captured before a Processing Session, how Execution Environment is separated from Context, how capabilities are declared, requested, negotiated, selected, composed into profiles, versioned through lifecycle states, and reflected in abstract Processing Results.

This specification does not define the Processor itself. VDP-0002 defines the Core Processor Model.

## Motivation

VDP-0002 establishes that Processor behavior is determined by equivalent context, profile, capability, configuration, policy, and declared inputs. VDP-0003 gives those concepts stable meaning and defines the pre-session negotiation boundary so concrete implementations can claim the same processing boundary without inventing incompatible capability models.

Without a shared Context and Capability model, Processors could silently rely on environment state, overclaim support, treat profiles as new behavior, confuse capability versions with Processor versions, or return results whose capability basis cannot be reconstructed.

## Goals

- Define immutable Processing Context.
- Define Execution Environment as separate from Processing Context.
- Define Capability, Capability Dependency, Capability Negotiation, Capability Lifecycle, and Processing Profile.
- Define abstract Processing Result Contract obligations without serialization.
- Define capability advertisement, request, selection, and result status semantics.
- Define profile composition without adding new behavior.
- Preserve VDP-0002 boundaries around discovery, catastrophic interruption, derived outputs, and deterministic processing.
- Address capability spoofing, profile escalation, unknown capabilities, conflicting declarations, version mismatches, and malicious extensions.

## Non Goals

- Define the Processor lifecycle or Processor authority model.
- Define diagnostics formats.
- Define manifest schema.
- Define CLI, MCP, HTTP, LSP, JSON, hosted API, or validator interfaces.
- Define extension wire protocol.
- Define repository graph serialization.
- Define implementation code, package layout, runtime behavior, or executable validation.
- Define concrete capability identifiers beyond illustrative examples.
- Define a complete profile registry.

## Terminology

- Processor Descriptor: A pre-session derived declaration of a Processor implementation's claimed support boundary.
- Processing Request: The caller's pre-session request for capabilities, profile, mode, policies, versions, and declared inputs.
- Negotiation Result: The pre-session result of comparing Processor Descriptor, Processing Request, capability definitions, dependencies, policies, environment availability, and supported versions.
- Processing Context: The immutable semantic input to a Processing Session, constructed only after negotiation completes sufficiently for the requested operation.
- Execution Environment: Runtime conditions under which a Processor executes.
- Capability: A declared unit of Processor behavior that can be advertised, requested, selected, negotiated, and reported.
- Capability Dependency: A relationship where one capability requires another capability.
- Capability Negotiation: The abstract pre-session process of comparing requested capabilities with Processor Descriptor support, definitions, dependencies, policy constraints, environment availability, and versions.
- Capability Lifecycle: The maturity status of a capability independent of Processor version.
- Processing Profile: A named composition of existing capabilities for a requested processing purpose.
- Requested Profile: The profile selected for a Processing Session.
- Capability Selection: The set of capabilities selected for a Processing Session after negotiation.
- Support Status: The semantic dimension describing whether an implementation can perform capability behavior.
- Availability Status: The semantic dimension describing whether supported behavior is executable in the current request, policy, dependency, version, and environment conditions.
- Dependency State: The semantic dimension describing whether required capability dependencies are satisfied, partially satisfied, unsatisfied, or unknown.
- Processing Result Contract: The abstract obligations a Processing Result must satisfy when reporting Context, capabilities, profile, lifecycle, and limitations.
- Mode: A declared processing mode that constrains how selected capabilities are used, without creating new capability behavior.

## Background

VDP-0001 defines repository discovery and produces a Discovered Repository Result. VDP-0002 defines the Processor and requires the Processor to consume that result, construct immutable Context, distinguish Context from Execution Environment, run mandatory and conditional lifecycle states, and keep outputs derived.

VDP-0003 defines the Context and capability model used by that Processor.

## Problem Statement

Processors need a common way to describe the semantic inputs and capability boundary for each Processing Session. The model must be immutable after Context construction, independent of runtime environment variation, explicit about unsupported or partial support, and precise enough for deterministic processing without defining concrete transport or serialization.

## Proposed Design

The abstract ordering is: Discovered Repository Result, Processor Descriptor, Processing Request, Capability Negotiation, Negotiation Result, Processing Context construction, Context freeze, VDP-0002 Processing Session, then Processing Result. Negotiation is pre-session orchestration. A concrete implementation may expose negotiation and processing through one command or API call, but the semantic boundaries remain distinct.

Processing Context is the immutable semantic bundle used by a Processor after negotiation. It contains or references the Processing Request, Processor Descriptor, Negotiation Result, selected capabilities, exact profile definition, declared policies and configuration, declared external inputs, Discovered Repository Result or equivalent discovered repository representation, accepted specifications and revisions, extensions and versions, mode, capability lifecycle sources, and relevant captured environment facts.

Execution Environment is separate. Filesystem access, network availability, sandbox, memory, interactive state, operating system, processor limits, clock, and process state may affect whether a Processor can execute, but they do not become authoritative input unless explicitly captured into Context or reported as limitations.

Capabilities describe everything a Processor can do. Negotiation separates implementation support, runtime availability, lifecycle maturity, and dependency state. Profiles compose capabilities for common purposes such as Validation, Migration, Documentation, Governance, Semantic Analysis, and Repository Analysis. Profiles never introduce behavior that is not already present through capabilities.

### VDP-0003-REQ-099 — Processor descriptor model

A Processor Descriptor MUST be a pre-session derived declaration of implementation family or product identity, implementation revision, build, release, or equivalent provenance, descriptor revision or snapshot identity, supported specification identifiers and versions, supported capability identifiers and versions, implementation-declared lifecycle claims, known authoritative lifecycle sources, supported profile identifiers and versions, material limitations, declared environment assumptions, and extension support boundary when applicable.

### VDP-0003-REQ-100 — Processor descriptor non-authority

A Processor Descriptor MUST NOT be treated as authoritative merely because a Processor emits it.

### VDP-0003-REQ-101 — Processing request model

A Processing Request MUST identify requested capabilities, requested profile and version, requested mode, applicable policies, declared external inputs, required capability versions, optional capabilities, and required capabilities when those values are part of the caller request.

### VDP-0003-REQ-102 — Negotiation result model

A Negotiation Result MUST identify selected capabilities, rejected capabilities, partially available capabilities, support status, availability status, authoritative lifecycle status when present, implementation-declared lifecycle claim when present, dependency state, version compatibility, material limitations, policy conflicts, and applicable lifecycle authority sources.

### VDP-0003-REQ-103 — Lifecycle authority

Authoritative capability or profile lifecycle status MUST derive from an Accepted Veridion specification, accepted capability registry or record, valid extension declaration under an accepted extension model, or another explicitly authorized artifact defined by an Accepted specification.

### VDP-0003-REQ-104 — Implementation lifecycle claims

Implementation-declared lifecycle claims MUST be identified as implementation-declared and non-authoritative when no authoritative lifecycle source exists.

### VDP-0003-REQ-105 — Lifecycle conflict handling

When an implementation-declared lifecycle claim conflicts with an authoritative lifecycle source, the authoritative source MUST govern, the conflict MUST be reported, and the Processor MUST NOT silently substitute its own claim.

### VDP-0003-REQ-106 — Context identity and result linkage

Every frozen Processing Context MUST have a stable context identity or equivalent reproducible provenance record, including the exact Processor Descriptor identity and Negotiation Result provenance, and a Processing Result MUST reference that exact identity or include an equivalent reproducible Context record.

### VDP-0003-REQ-107 — No fabricated reconstruction

If exact Context reconstruction is impossible, the Processing Result MUST disclose the limitation, MUST NOT claim full reproducibility, and MUST NOT fabricate missing provenance.

### VDP-0003-REQ-108 — Capability namespace categories

Capability identifiers MUST identify a source namespace or authority class such as core capability, organization-qualified capability, extension-qualified capability, or local experimental capability without defining a final registry format.

### VDP-0003-REQ-109 — Namespace collision handling

Two capability declarations with the same identifier but incompatible definitions MUST be reported as a conflict; unqualified identifiers MUST NOT be used by third-party extensions; unknown namespaces MUST be preserved and reported safely; and namespace ownership MUST NOT be inferred from repository hosting, popularity, or governance authority.

### VDP-0003-REQ-110 — Profile identity and authority

A Processing Profile MUST identify stable profile identifier, profile version, source or authority, composed capability identifiers and version constraints, required and optional capabilities, dependency closure, lifecycle status when applicable, material limitations, and compatibility expectations.

### VDP-0003-REQ-111 — Profile conflict handling

Profiles that share a display name but differ in identifier, version, source, or capability composition MUST be treated as distinct profiles and MUST NOT be silently merged.

### VDP-0003-REQ-112 — Dependency closure evidence

Negotiation Result and Processing Context MUST preserve the resolved required dependency closure or an equivalent reproducible reference, including transitive required dependencies, version constraints, lifecycle compatibility, support status, availability status, policy restrictions, extension requirements, unknown dependencies, and cycles.

### Review Resolution

### VDP-0003-REQ-113 — Descriptor mutation and renegotiation

A Processor Descriptor used for negotiation MUST NOT silently change before Context freeze; if the implementation support boundary changes materially, negotiation MUST restart or the change MUST be reported and the request MUST NOT proceed as though the old Descriptor remained valid.

### VDP-0003-REQ-114 — Absent authoritative lifecycle

When no authoritative lifecycle source exists for a capability or profile, authoritative lifecycle status MUST be treated as absent or unknown; any implementation-declared lifecycle claim MUST be marked non-authoritative; negotiation MUST disclose the absence; absence MUST NOT automatically make the capability or profile unsupported; and conformance claims requiring authoritative maturity MUST NOT pass.

### VDP-0003-REQ-115 — Negotiation policy precedence

For negotiation scope only, conflicts MUST be interpreted according to this minimum precedence: Accepted Constitution, accepted applicable VDPs, valid governance records within granted scope, authoritative capability or profile definitions, valid extension declarations within accepted extension authority, declared repository or organizational policy within granted scope, local request preferences, then implementation defaults.

### VDP-0003-REQ-116 — Policy conflict handling

Out-of-scope policy effects MUST be reported and ignored for normative or conformance conclusions, while valid in-scope policy effects MUST be identified in declared inputs, appear in the Negotiation Result, be preserved in Processing Context, and be reflected in the Processing Result when they affect execution or interpretation; unresolvable authority or scope conflicts MUST prevent full negotiation success for the affected operation.

### VDP-0003-REQ-117 — Open availability baseline

Version 0.1.0 availability categories are a minimum open semantic set; every Negotiation Result MUST express an availability condition semantically equivalent to one or more baseline categories, future accepted specifications MAY add more specific categories, unknown future categories MUST be preserved and reported, processors MUST NOT silently map unknown categories to available, and serialization remains deferred.

## Informative Notes

VDP-0003 turns VDP-0002's corrected boundary into a concrete context and capability vocabulary. It does not create implementation behavior by itself. Concrete processors, validators, CLIs, MCP servers, hosted services, and IDE extensions may use this model without changing its authority boundary.

## Architecture

The abstract flow is:

```text
Candidate location
  -> VDP-0001 discovery
  -> Discovered Repository Result
  -> Processor Descriptor
  -> Processing Request
  -> Capability Negotiation
  -> Negotiation Result
  -> Processing Context construction
  -> Context freeze
  -> Processor execution under VDP-0002
  -> Processing Result Contract
```

Execution Environment surrounds the flow but is not the same as Processing Context.

## Interfaces

This specification defines no concrete interface. It defines semantic expectations for future interfaces that expose Processor Descriptors, receive Processing Requests, negotiate support and availability, construct Context after negotiation, and present Processing Results.

## Algorithms

Capability selection pseudocode:

```text
collect Processor Descriptor
collect Processing Request
collect authoritative capability and profile definitions when available
expand profile into existing capabilities
resolve required and optional capability dependencies
verify required dependency closure is acyclic and complete
classify support status as supported, partially_supported, or unsupported
classify availability status such as available, blocked_by_policy, unavailable_in_environment, dependency_unsatisfied, version_incompatible, or deferred
record lifecycle status and lifecycle authority source
produce Negotiation Result
construct Processing Context from request, descriptor, negotiation result, repository result, specifications, policies, configuration, extensions, mode, and declared external inputs
freeze Processing Context
```

The dependency graph must be acyclic. Unknown required dependencies are reported through negotiation rather than causing undefined behavior or false support claims.

## Evidence Requirements

Evidence for conformance may include Processor Descriptors, Processing Requests, capability definitions, profile definitions, dependency relationships, Negotiation Results, Context identity or provenance records, Result Contract records, lifecycle authority records, and examples of unsupported, partially supported, unavailable, deprecated, removed, unknown, and dependency-unsatisfied handling.

## Reasoning Requirements

Processors should distinguish Context facts, Environment limits, implementation support, availability, dependency state, capability claims, negotiated selections, profile composition, lifecycle maturity, lifecycle authority source, and derived result conclusions. A capability claim is not authority; it is a declared behavior boundary.

## Validation Strategy

Validation can check metadata, canonical sections, contiguous requirement identifiers, dependency references, negotiation ordering, Context identity, Context immutability language, Environment separation, capability lifecycle coverage and authority source, acyclic dependency closure requirements, support and availability status separation, profile identity rules, deferred boundary preservation, and consistency with VDP-0002.

## Scoring Considerations

Not applicable. Processing Context and Capability Model does not define scoring.

## Security Considerations

Capability and profile systems are security-sensitive because a malicious processor, extension, configuration, policy, or hosted surface could overclaim support, spoof lifecycle status, fake namespace authority, smuggle environment state into Context, downgrade capability versions, omit dependency closure, or use a profile to request behavior outside its negotiated boundary.

## Performance Considerations

Capability negotiation should be bounded by declared capability, profile, and dependency graphs. Processors may use caches or indexes for performance, but those aids remain derived and must not change Context identity, dependency closure, or negotiated capability meaning.

## Compatibility

This draft supports future concrete interfaces by defining the abstract model only. Unknown future capabilities, namespaces, profiles, lifecycle states, profile sources, and extension declarations should be preserved where possible, reported when relevant, and never silently reinterpreted.

## Migration

No current implementation is migrated by this draft. Future Processor implementations should align their Processor Descriptor, Processing Request handling, Negotiation Result, Context construction, capability advertisement, profile composition, and result reporting with VDP-0003 before claiming capability-model conformance.

## Extensibility

Future VDPs may define diagnostics, concrete capability registries, profile registries, manifest integration, extension protocols, result serialization, repository graph serialization, CLI, MCP, HTTP, LSP, hosted APIs, and validator interfaces. Those extensions must preserve Context immutability, Environment separation, and derived-output boundaries.

## Alternatives Considered

- Put Context and capability rules in VDP-0002: rejected because VDP-0002 defines the Processor and this draft defines the inputs and capability model used by it.
- Treat Execution Environment as Context: rejected because mutable runtime conditions would undermine determinism.
- Let profiles define new behavior: rejected because profiles should compose existing capabilities.
- Define JSON result contracts now: deferred to avoid prematurely binding the abstract model to serialization.

## Open Questions

- Which capability identifiers should be standardized first?
- Should capability and profile registries live in manifests, schemas, records, or separate specifications?
- How should extension-provided capabilities be isolated?
- Which Processing Result serialization should be specified first?
- How should deprecated and removed capabilities be tested in conformance fixtures?

## Future Work
