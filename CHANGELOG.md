# Changelog

Notable changes to Veridion, by release. The working code lives in `prototype/` — see
[`prototype/README.md`](prototype/README.md) for the full command reference.

## Unreleased

- Added `.github/workflows/tests.yml` — the test suite (182 tests) now actually runs in CI on
  every push/PR, across Python 3.11 and 3.12. Previously nothing ran it automatically.
- Added real PyPI packaging (full metadata in `prototype/pyproject.toml`) and
  `.github/workflows/publish-pypi.yml`, which publishes via trusted publishing whenever a
  GitHub Release is published. Not live yet — needs the PyPI-side trusted-publisher
  registration first.

## 0.1.1 — 2026-07-16

- The `Veridion Diff` GitHub Action now posts its findings as a PR comment (updating the same
  comment on later pushes) instead of only exposing a `diff-json` step output.
- Added `fail-on-new-vulnerabilities` and `fail-on-new-layer-violations` inputs (and matching
  `veridion diff` CLI flags), alongside the existing `fail-on-new-secrets`.
- Dependency-vulnerability checking is now actually enabled in the Action's scan steps — it
  was previously skipped via `--no-check-vulnerabilities`, which would have made the new
  vulnerabilities fail-gate permanently dead.
- Added inline Checks-API annotations for new secrets, landing on the exact changed line in
  a PR's "Files changed" tab.
- The Action now writes to the run's Step Summary on every run, not just `pull_request` events,
  so a plain push still shows results somewhere.

## 0.1.0 — 2026-07-16

- First tagged release. Published as the `Veridion Diff` GitHub Action on the Marketplace: a
  composite Action that scans a PR's base and head refs and diffs them — new/resolved secrets,
  secrets found in git history, dependency vulnerabilities, layer-convention violations, and
  aggregate deltas (module/edge/commit counts).
- Everything the Action builds on already existed in the CLI before this release: `veridion
  scan`/`audit`/`query`/`diff`, an MCP server (13 tools), and a local live dashboard.
