# Veridion Constitution

## Abstract

This Draft Constitution defines the internal authority model for Veridion. It establishes constitutional supremacy, artifact-centered authority, bounded roles, phased governance, proposal authority, emergency limits, appeals, succession, repository portability, constitutional amendment rules, contributor protections, and the boundary between human governance and AI or automated assistance.

The constitutional model is phased: Founder Stewardship, then Maintainer Governance, then Constitutional Governance. The first phase begins only after valid initial ratification. Before ratification, Arihant Kaul remains the practical repository owner and project steward under existing repository reality, not under accepted constitutional authority. This draft does not ratify itself, does not activate any constitutional phase, does not activate the Steering Council, and does not create permanent founder authority.

## Motivation

Veridion is intended to become a long-lived, open, evidence-driven engineering framework. Long-lived open-source systems need clear authority before disputes, commercial pressure, implementation divergence, repository migration, automation, or contributor growth make authority ambiguous.

Without a Constitution, governance could silently collapse into repository ownership, implementation control, social popularity, vendor influence, private memory, or generated summaries. That would conflict with the Veridion Proposal System, which treats durable, inspectable artifacts as the source of specification authority.

## Goals

- Define the highest internal normative authority for Veridion.
- Make all governance authority explicit, traceable, bounded, and reviewable.
- Establish a practical early-stage founder stewardship model without making founder control permanent.
- Define a credible transition path to maintainer and constitutional governance.
- Define roles, powers, prohibitions, accountability, appointment, removal, continuity, and succession.
- Preserve the distinction between Accepted specifications and implementations.
- Protect independent conforming implementations from vendor, runtime, platform, or repository-forge favoritism.
- Define how VDPs become authoritative before and after institutional governance exists.
- Define dispute, appeal, emergency, inactivity, dormancy, repository migration, and fork behavior.
- Define how constitutional interpretation differs from constitutional amendment.
- Preserve contributor rights while allowing proportionate moderation and infrastructure protection.
- Keep AI and automated systems useful without granting them governance authority.
- Define one-time constituent ratification for the first Accepted Constitution without exercising it in this draft.

## Non Goals

- Ratify this Constitution.
- Mark VDP-0000 as Discussion or Accepted.
- Activate the Veridion Steering Council.
- Appoint Maintainers, Editors, Reviewers, Council members, or Working Groups.
- Define detailed election mechanics.
- Create a full code of conduct, trademark policy, or certification program.
- Implement governance software, CLI commands, MCP resources, or repository automation.
- Grant AI systems, agents, CI, or generated artifacts governance authority.
- Override VDP--001.
- Make GitHub constitutionally authoritative merely because it hosts the current repository.
- Resolve all future governance edge cases in Version 0.1.0.

## Terminology

- Constitution: The Accepted Veridion Constitution identified as `VDP-0000`.
- Constitutional amendment: A reviewed change to the Accepted Constitution.
- Constitutional Steward: The early-stage steward role held initially by Arihant Kaul during Founder Stewardship.
- Maintainer: A trusted participant with bounded repository or technical responsibilities.
- VDP Editor: A procedural custodian for VDP metadata, format, lifecycle gates, and transition recording.
- Reviewer: A person providing scoped evaluation of a proposal, implementation, evidence set, or governance action.
- Contributor: A human participant proposing, reviewing, implementing, reporting, or improving Veridion work.
- Working Group: A temporary or standing group chartered for a bounded scope.
- Veridion Steering Council: The future institutional governance body beneath the Constitution.
- Governance phase: One of Founder Stewardship, Maintainer Governance, or Constitutional Governance.
- Canonical repository: The repository or storage location designated by valid governance records as the current authoritative source location.
- Canonical source revision: A source revision identified by a durable revision identifier in the canonical repository or accepted archive.
- Official mirror: A mirror designated by governance records for availability or archival use without becoming independently authoritative.
- Archival copy: A preserved copy used for historical inspection.
- Authority transfer: A recorded change moving canonical authority to another repository, forge, storage system, or institutional custodian.
- Governance record: An inspectable record of authority, decision, appointment, delegation, transition, emergency, amendment, appeal, or ratification.
- Constituent Ratification Record: The one-time record by which the first Accepted revision of VDP-0000 may be ratified.
- Material conflict of interest: A financial, employment, vendor, personal, organizational, authorship, or implementation-control interest that materially compromises impartial governance judgment.

## Background

VDP--001 established the Veridion Proposal System and was accepted at version 1.0.0. Its bootstrap authority applied only to VDP--001 and expired immediately after that transition. VDP-0000 therefore requires its own constituent ratification mechanism rather than relying on the expired VDP--001 bootstrap authority.

The current project is early-stage. Arihant Kaul is the repository owner and principal steward as a practical repository matter. No constitutional role derives authority from this Draft Constitution before ratification. The project does not yet have an active Steering Council or a broad maintainer body capable of institutional governance. The Constitution must work in that early context while preventing early convenience from becoming permanent personal rule.

## Problem Statement

Veridion needs a constitutional authority model that remains valid across growth, forks, repository migration, commercial involvement, implementation competition, automation, emergencies, inactivity, and founder succession.

The central problem is to make authority durable without freezing the project in its founding state. Governance must be strong enough to prevent silent capture by repository administrators, implementation owners, vendors, AI systems, or informal popularity, while remaining practical for an early project that has not yet formed a council.

## Proposed Design

The Constitution is organized around five pillars: Authority, Governance, Integrity, Evolution, and Stewardship.

Authority establishes that the Accepted Constitution is the highest internal normative authority, that all governance power must be traceable to records, and that implementations and generated artifacts do not override specifications.

Governance defines bounded roles, governance phases, proposal authority, decision thresholds, conflicts, appeals, and institutional transition.

Integrity protects history, provenance, review records, conflict disclosure, emergency limits, repository portability, and the separation between interpretation and amendment.

Evolution defines constitutional amendment, versioning, ratification, succession, and future governance growth.

Stewardship defines early founder responsibility, contributor protections, institutional independence, moderation boundaries, dormancy, archival behavior, and the role of humans and automated systems.

### Role Model Summary

| Role | Core powers | Prohibitions | Appointment and continuity | Removal or end | Accountability |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Constitutional Steward | Early stewardship, ordinary VDP authorization after gates, initial role appointments, emergency protective action, transition initiation. | No silent gate bypass, fabricated review, AI approval substitution, permanent extra-constitutional grants, or unilateral authority after Council activation. | Initially Arihant Kaul upon valid initial ratification; successor may be designated by public succession record. | Broad powers end at Constitutional Governance; interim replacement is limited to continuity and transition. | Accepted Constitution and governance records. |
| Maintainer | Assigned technical maintenance, review, authorized merge, eligible governance participation, role nomination. | No automatic constitutional amendment authority, unilateral VDP acceptance authority, unrestricted repository authority, or authority beyond assignment. | Appointed by eligible authority with a record. | Resignation, inactivity, suspension, or removal record. | Constitution, assigned area records, and active governance authority. |
| VDP Editor | Metadata and format checks, identifier confirmation, lifecycle gate checks, review coordination, authorized transition recording. | No approval by editorship alone, no technical-merit decision solely as editor, no unauthorized normative change, no fabricated approval. | Appointed by eligible authority with a record. | Removal, inactivity, resignation, or replacement record. | VDP--001, Constitution, and active governance authority. |
| Reviewer | Scoped evaluation of architecture, security, performance, compatibility, governance, evidence, feasibility, or editorial correctness. | Reviewer listing does not automatically mean approval; conflicts must not be hidden. | Review assignment or participation record. | Review completion, withdrawal, conflict, or governance record. | Review scope and review record. |
| Contributor | Author proposals, submit implementation, report defects, challenge decisions, request review, fork under license. | No governance authority merely by contribution; no guaranteed merge, role, acceptance, or confidential access. | Human participation in project work. | Proportionate moderation or restriction process when required. | Constitution and applicable project records. |
| Working Group | Chartered delivery and recommendations within a bounded scope. | No constitutional authority through activity or popularity. | Charter defining scope, membership, leadership, decision process, and duration. | Charter expiry, dissolution, replacement, or removal record. | Charter and active governance authority. |
| Veridion Steering Council | Permanent governance authority beneath the Constitution after activation. | No override of Constitution, hidden conflicts, repository-owner supremacy, or AI delegation of accountable judgment. | Activated only through valid transition record; members serve recorded terms. | Term expiry, resignation, removal, vacancy procedure, or inactivity record. | Accepted Constitution and Council decision records. |
| Interim Constitutional Steward | Continuity protection and governance transition after pre-Council Steward unavailability. | No unrestricted founder replacement or permanent authority expansion. | Appointed by active Maintainers after 90 days unavailability, two-thirds approval, at least two affirmative votes, and public record. | Ends when successor, Steward, or institutional governance is validly established. | Constitution, appointment record, and active Maintainers. |

### VDP-0000-REQ-003 — Traceable authority

Governance authority MUST be traceable to the Constitution, an Accepted VDP, an appointment record, an election or selection record, a delegation record, or a valid acceptance or decision record.

### VDP-0000-REQ-004 — No implied authority from access

Technical access, repository ownership, employment, popularity, convention, implementation control, or administrative permission MUST NOT by itself create governance authority.

### VDP-0000-REQ-005 — Authority hierarchy

An accepted constitutional amendment MUST become part of the current Constitution and MUST NOT remain a separate authority above the Constitution.

### VDP-0000-REQ-007 — Specification supremacy

An implementation MUST NOT redefine an Accepted specification merely because it is official, deployed, popular, historically first, or controlled by a privileged maintainer.

### VDP-0000-REQ-008 — Implementation defects

When an implementation conflicts with an Accepted specification, the conflict MUST be treated as an implementation defect, deviation, or amendment proposal rather than silent specification change.

### Initial Ratification and Transitional Provisions

### VDP-0000-REQ-101 — Initial constituent ratification

Arihant Kaul, as repository owner and current project steward, MAY ratify the first Accepted revision of VDP-0000 only after a complete acceptance-readiness audit, at least 21 calendar days of public review after the first complete Discussion revision is published, an inspectable review record identifying start and end dates, and an explicit Constituent Ratification Record. Material normative changes restart the 21-day review period; editorial changes do not.

### VDP-0000-REQ-102 — Ratification scope

Initial constituent ratification authority applies only to the first Accepted revision of VDP-0000, expires immediately upon ratification, does not authorize unilateral future amendments, does not authorize bypassing VDP--001, and MUST be identified as a founding act rather than permanent governance.

### VDP-0000-REQ-103 — No ratification in draft

This Draft Constitution MUST NOT be treated as ratified, Accepted, or constitutionally active.

### VDP-0000-REQ-104 — Bootstrap history

VDP-0000 records that VDP--001 established the proposal system, VDP--001 bootstrap authority applied only to VDP--001, that authority expired, and future governance derives from the Accepted Constitution after valid ratification.

### VDP-0000-REQ-105 — Deferred topic safety

Deferred governance topics MUST have safe interim rules and MUST NOT leave core constitutional authority unresolved.

### VDP-0000-REQ-106 — Pre-Council constitutional amendments

Before Steering Council activation, constitutional amendments MUST follow the phase-specific Founder Stewardship or Maintainer Governance amendment authority defined by this Constitution and MUST NOT rely on vague transitional authority.

### Maintainer Governance Continuity

### VDP-0000-REQ-107 — Maintainer Governance ordinary acceptance

During Maintainer Governance, the Constitutional Steward remains a constitutional role until Council activation, but ordinary VDP acceptance authority MUST be shared. Ordinary VDP acceptance MUST require VDP--001 gates, an inspectable decision record, participation by at least two non-recused active Maintainers, at least two affirmative votes, a majority of participating eligible Maintainers, no tie, and no counting of abstentions as affirmative votes. The Constitutional Steward MAY participate only when eligible and not recused.

### VDP-0000-REQ-108 — Maintainer Governance reserved powers

During Maintainer Governance, constitutional amendment ratification, Steering Council activation, removal of core contributor protections, permanent authority transfer, and emergency authority beyond explicit emergency rules MUST NOT be delegated informally.

### VDP-0000-REQ-109 — Delegation and stalled transition

Any delegation of governance authority MUST be written, identify scope, duration or review condition, delegator and recipient, remain within already-held powers, be revocable, and create no broader authority than the Constitution permits. If Maintainer Governance remains active for 12 months without Council formation, a governance review MUST record reasons for delay and MUST continue the phase only through an explicit continuity record assessing Council activation, return to Founder Stewardship, or dormancy.

### Initial Steering Council Formation

### VDP-0000-REQ-110 — Initial Council candidate and slate requirements

An initial Steering Council candidate MUST be an active Maintainer with a public role record, disclosed material conflicts, accepted Council responsibilities, and human individual status rather than AI system, automated agent, company, or organizational account. The initial slate MUST contain three to seven candidates, at least two candidates who are not Arihant Kaul, no more than one person representing the same employer or controlling organization where practicable, and an odd number where practicable.

### VDP-0000-REQ-111 — Initial Council nomination and review

Initial Council candidates MAY be nominated by the Constitutional Steward, active Maintainers, or self-nomination with recorded disclosure. The proposed slate MUST undergo at least 21 calendar days of public review, publication of role history and conflict disclosures, opportunity for objections, and resolution or explicit disposition of Blocking objections.

### VDP-0000-REQ-112 — Initial Council approval and activation

During Maintainer Governance, the initial Council slate MUST receive two-thirds approval of active non-recused Maintainers, at least three affirmative votes, affirmative approval by the Constitutional Steward unless the Steward is recused or unavailable under succession rules, and an inspectable Council Activation Record. If the Steward is unavailable or materially conflicted, approval MAY proceed only with three-quarters approval of active non-recused Maintainers, at least three affirmative votes, and an independent governance review record. The Council becomes active only when the Council Activation Record is merged or otherwise incorporated into the canonical repository; at that same moment Constitutional Governance begins, broad unilateral Steward authority expires, Council terms begin, and repository ownership confers no additional constitutional power. A failed slate does not activate the Council and does not permanently bar revised candidates.

### Phase-Specific Amendment Authority

### VDP-0000-REQ-113 — Constitutional amendment authority by phase

During Founder Stewardship, a constitutional amendment MUST require proposal under VDP--001, at least 21 calendar days of public review, explicit amendment text, compatibility, migration, authority, and rights-impact analysis, acceptance-readiness audit, disposition of Blocking objections, Constitutional Amendment Ratification Record, and explicit Steward ratification. The Steward MUST NOT ratify an amendment solely on self-review; if no independent reviewer is available, that lack must be disclosed and review MUST last at least 30 days. During Maintainer Governance, the same requirements apply and the amendment MUST also receive two-thirds approval of active non-recused Maintainers, at least three affirmative votes, and Steward ratification unless unavailable or recused; if unavailable or recused, it MUST receive three-quarters approval of active non-recused Maintainers, at least three affirmative votes, and an independent governance review record. During Constitutional Governance, REQ-050 applies. No phase MAY amend the Constitution through emergency action, repository access, silence as ratification, or AI-generated approval.

### Limited Continuity and Reduced Council

### VDP-0000-REQ-114 — Limited Continuity trigger and restrictions

If the Constitutional Steward is unavailable for at least 90 consecutive days, no successor exists, and fewer than two active Maintainers are available, no new constitutional authority MAY be invented and the project enters Limited Continuity. During Limited Continuity, repository administrators MAY perform only preservation, security, credential rotation, availability, backup, and archival actions; ordinary VDP acceptance, constitutional amendment, and role appointments pause except restoration of previously recorded access; all actions require continuity records; and the project MAY be declared Dormant after 180 days if no eligible authority is restored.

### VDP-0000-REQ-115 — Limited Continuity recovery

Limited Continuity ends only when the recorded Steward returns, a recorded successor assumes the role, at least two active Maintainers become eligible and appoint an Interim Constitutional Steward, an already valid Council resumes authority, or a legally necessary archival action concludes the project.

### VDP-0000-REQ-116 — Reduced Council operation

When active Council membership falls below three, remaining Council members MAY only preserve repository and governance records, fill vacancies under constitutional process, take time-limited emergency protective action, maintain essential infrastructure, initiate dormancy or archival review, and publish continuity records. A reduced Council MUST NOT accept ordinary VDPs, ratify amendments, permanently transfer canonical authority, remove contributor protections, appoint itself to new terms, or exercise unrestricted Council authority. Reduced Council operation MUST be reviewed every 30 days, and if membership is not restored within 90 days the project MUST enter Limited Continuity or Dormant status with recorded reason and recovery path.

### Conflicted Governance and Rights Protection

### VDP-0000-REQ-117 — All-participants-conflicted fallback

When all otherwise eligible decision-makers share the same material conflict, the conflict MUST be publicly disclosed where legally and safely possible, non-essential decisions MUST pause, only preservation, security, legal compliance, and time-limited emergency actions MAY proceed, independent review MUST be sought, and any unavailable independent review MUST be recorded with limitation and residual risk. External reviewers may advise but do not automatically receive constitutional authority. Conflicted actors MUST NOT conceal the conflict because no alternative exists, and permanent constitutional amendments or rights reductions MUST pause until independent participation is restored.

### VDP-0000-REQ-118 — Rights-reducing amendments

An amendment materially reducing contributor protections in REQ-094 through REQ-097 or related rights MUST use a MAJOR constitutional version, receive at least 30 calendar days of public review, include explicit rights-impact analysis, preserve objections and dissent, and MUST NOT use emergency procedure or proceed while all eligible decision-makers share the same material conflict. After Council activation it MUST receive three-quarters approval of all non-recused Council membership and at least three affirmative votes. Before Council activation it MUST receive three-quarters approval of eligible non-recused Maintainers, at least three affirmative votes, and explicit Steward ratification. If the project lacks enough eligible participants to satisfy the threshold, the rights reduction does not pass.

### VDP-0000-REQ-119 — Hard minimums and recusal math

Recusal recalculates eligible participation for percentage thresholds, but MUST NOT lower hard minimum affirmative vote counts stated by this Constitution.

## Informative Notes

The constitutional pillars operate together. Authority without stewardship becomes rigid; stewardship without authority records becomes personal rule; governance without integrity becomes social convention; evolution without amendment discipline becomes silent drift.

This Draft Constitution deliberately names the current founder role because the project is still in an early phase. Before ratification, that role is descriptive only and grants no constitutional authority. Naming the current steward is not intended to create permanent founder sovereignty. The intended trajectory is institutional authority under accepted constitutional artifacts.

## Architecture

The constitutional architecture has three layers: authoritative artifacts, accountable human roles, and supporting operational systems.

Authoritative artifacts include the Accepted Constitution, accepted constitutional amendments incorporated into it, Accepted VDPs, decision records, appointment records, delegation records, transition records, emergency records, appeal records, and ratification records.

Accountable human roles include the Constitutional Steward, Maintainers, VDP Editors, Reviewers, Contributors, Working Groups, Interim Constitutional Steward, and, when activated, the Veridion Steering Council.

Operational systems include the canonical repository, official mirrors, CI, validation tooling, hosted rendering, issue trackers, agents, and future MCP or CLI surfaces. These systems support governance but do not possess constitutional authority.

## Interfaces

The primary interface is the Markdown VDP. Governance interfaces include governance records, decision records, appointment records, review records, appeal records, emergency records, and transition records.

Future tools may expose constitutional status, role records, authority chains, or governance diagnostics. Such tools must preserve source provenance and must not convert generated output into authority.

## Algorithms

Constitutional evaluation is not a purely algorithmic process. Mechanical checks may extract metadata, sections, requirement identifiers, role records, decision thresholds, review periods, and source revision references.

A governance auditor may follow this conceptual process: identify the relevant constitutional text, identify the claimed authority, locate the supporting record, verify phase and role eligibility, check conflicts and recusals, verify thresholds, verify timing requirements, and record unevaluated human-judgment dimensions.

## Evidence Requirements

Governance evidence should be inspectable, durable, attributable, and scoped. Evidence may include accepted VDPs, review records, decision records, Git commits, signed or otherwise attributable statements, issue or pull request records, security incident records, appointment records, and migration records.

Sensitive evidence may be summarized or access-controlled when publication would create harm. The public record should preserve enough scope, rationale, and authority to make the decision reviewable without exposing secrets.

## Reasoning Requirements

Constitutional reasoning should distinguish facts, assumptions, interpretations, risk judgments, authority claims, and normative requirements. Acceptance-critical reasoning must not depend on private memory, hidden model output, or inaccessible discussions.

Where the Constitution uses SHOULD, deviation is permitted only with an understood and recorded reason.

## Validation Strategy

Constitutional conformance may be assessed through these classes:

- Repository-inspectable: files, metadata, source revisions, records, and history.
- Record-verifiable: appointments, decisions, votes, recusals, ratifications, transitions, and emergency actions.
- Role-verifiable: whether a person or body held the relevant role at the relevant time.
- Process-verifiable: whether required stages, reviews, thresholds, and records occurred.
- Time-verifiable: review periods, emergency expiry, inactivity periods, and archival dates.
- Human-judgment-dependent: good faith, fairness, proportionality, evidence sufficiency, conflict materiality, and legitimacy.

Governance legitimacy must not be reduced to automated schema validation. A future tool may identify missing records or invalid transitions, but it cannot establish good faith, fairness, or legitimate human judgment automatically.

## Scoring Considerations

Constitutional legitimacy must not be reduced to one numeric score. Governance audits may report dimensions, findings, confidence, and unevaluated areas, but no automated score may substitute for authority, due process, or human judgment.

## Security Considerations

Threats include repository administrator compromise, forged governance records, unauthorized status transitions, account takeover, coercion, undisclosed conflicts, malicious forks, hostile governance capture, maintainer collusion, founder unavailability, compromised automation, AI impersonation of human approval, emergency-power abuse, deletion of historical records, and publication of sensitive evidence.

Mitigations include artifact-centered authority, source revision identifiers, inspectable records, conflict disclosure, recusal, role limits, emergency expiry, provenance preservation, canonical repository records, no AI approval authority, repository-compromise rules, and archival obligations.

## Performance Considerations

Constitutional governance should remain usable without complex software. A small project must be able to inspect Markdown records manually. As Veridion grows, indexes and tools may help locate authority chains, role records, conflicts, and decisions, but those tools remain supporting systems.

## Compatibility

This Draft Constitution depends on VDP--001 and is written in VDP format version 1.0. It preserves the VDP--001 identifier model by using `VDP-0000` as the standard constitutional identifier.

The phased model is compatible with the current project state and with future institutional governance. It is intended to remain valid across repository migration, official mirrors, forks, commercial support, and independent implementations.

## Migration

Migration from founder-only stewardship to institutional governance requires recorded governance transition. Existing repository history and accepted VDPs must remain inspectable. Authority must migrate through records, not through unrecorded social assumption.

If Veridion migrates repositories or forges, the migration record must identify the prior canonical repository, new canonical repository, effective source revision, official mirrors, archived copies, and authority-transfer rationale.

## Extensibility

Future specifications may define elections, Working Group charter templates, a formal contributor code of conduct, trademark policy, certification program, cryptographic attestations, confidential security-review procedure, conformance manifests, and governance tooling.

Extensions must preserve the constitutional supremacy and human accountability boundaries defined here.

## Alternatives Considered

Permanent founder control was rejected because it would make the project permanently personal and conflict with constitutional supremacy.

Pure contributor voting was rejected because broad voting can be vulnerable to low-context participation, capture, identity ambiguity, and lack of accountable stewardship.

Pure maintainer meritocracy was rejected because technical contribution alone does not define constitutional legitimacy or protect contributors from opaque authority.

A fully centralized council from day one was rejected because Veridion does not yet have a broad, independent maintainer body.

Corporate governance was rejected because funding, employment, and commercial implementation should not automatically create constitutional authority.

AI-assisted voting was rejected because AI may assist analysis but must not exercise human governance authority.

Implementation-owner authority was rejected because implementation popularity must not redefine specifications.

GitHub-owner authority was rejected because repository hosting and constitutional authority must remain separate.

Informal consensus without recorded decisions was rejected because it cannot reliably preserve authority, dissent, evidence, or historical accountability.

The phased constitutional model is preferred because it works for the current founding state while requiring a transition to institutional authority.

## Open Questions

- Detailed election mechanics: deferred to a future governance election specification. Interim rule: no election is required until the Constitution or a transition record invokes one.
- Formal contributor code of conduct: deferred to future community governance work. Interim rule: moderation and removal must follow the proportionality and review rules in this Constitution.
- Trademark policy: deferred to future legal or governance policy. Interim rule: no party may imply governance endorsement without an endorsement record.
- Certification program: deferred to future conformance or certification specifications. Interim rule: conformance claims must follow applicable VDP requirements and must not imply official endorsement.
- Cryptographic governance attestations: deferred to a future integrity specification. Interim rule: source revision identifiers and inspectable records remain required.
- Confidential security-review procedure: deferred to future security governance. Interim rule: sensitive evidence may be restricted while public records preserve scope and authority.
- Exact Working Group charter template: deferred to future governance templates. Interim rule: each charter must contain the elements required by VDP-0000.

These deferrals do not block constitutional interpretation because the interim rules preserve authority, accountability, and reviewability.

## Future Work

Future work includes moving VDP-0000 from Draft to Discussion, conducting external constitutional review, performing an acceptance-readiness audit, defining a Constituent Ratification Record, and later developing specifications for governance elections, community conduct, trademarks, certification, attestations, confidential security review, and Working Group templates.

## Appendices

### Appendix A — Governance Phases

No constitutional governance phase is active while VDP-0000 remains Draft or otherwise unratified. Upon valid initial ratification, Founder Stewardship becomes the first active phase. Maintainer Governance may begin through a Governance Transition Record. Constitutional Governance begins only when the Steering Council is activated through a valid transition record.

### Appendix B — Failure Scenario Behavior

If the founder leaves without notice or becomes inactive, succession or Interim Constitutional Steward rules apply after 90 consecutive days. If the founder attempts to bypass the Constitution after Council activation, the attempted action lacks constitutional authority. If a sole Maintainer claims project authority, the claim fails unless supported by valid records. If the Council deadlocks, no decision occurs. If Council membership falls below three, Council authority is limited to vacancy and continuity handling. If a repository owner removes legitimate maintainers, repository access does not by itself change constitutional authority. If the repository is compromised, malicious default-branch changes are not constitutionally valid. If a hostile fork claims to be canonical, it must show a valid authority transfer or succession record. If company funding creates pressure, organizational conflicts must be disclosed and recusal may be required. If AI-generated approval is submitted as human approval, it is invalid. If emergency powers are not reviewed, the action expires and the failure is a governance defect. If an amendment removes contributor protections, it requires the constitutional amendment threshold and impact analysis. If the project becomes dormant, dormancy must be recorded and must not imply current support. If all active governance participants share the same organizational conflict, the conflict must be disclosed and governance action should be limited to preservation until independent review is possible.

### Appendix C — Bootstrap History

VDP--001 established the Veridion Proposal System. VDP--001 bootstrap authority applied only to VDP--001 and expired immediately after its first acceptance. VDP-0000 uses a separate one-time constituent ratification process. That process has not been exercised in this draft. The ratification mechanism will expire after the first Accepted Constitution. Future governance derives from the Accepted Constitution.
